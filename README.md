# RL-MDO-N2-Diagrams

This repository contains system-level N² diagrams related to the dissertation:

**"Advancing Conceptual Aircraft Design using Reinforcement Learning–Based Multidisciplinary Design Optimization"**  
by H. Rahmani (2025)

These diagrams were generated using OpenMDAO and represent the component hierarchy, coupling structure, and data flow of the multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) models developed in this research.
